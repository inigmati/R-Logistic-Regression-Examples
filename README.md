Weâ€™ll be working on the Titanic dataset. Dataset link is :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/3136/download-all
The dataset (training) is a collection of data about some of the passengers (889 to be precise), and the goal is to predict the survival (either 1 if the passenger survived or 0 if they did not) based on some features such as the class of service, the sex, the age etc.
we are going to use both categorical and continuous variables.
